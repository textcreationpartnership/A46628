            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <lg>
               <l>I Bring mean Things, as <hi>Hecuba</hi> who gave</l>
               <l>Her Hair a Sacrifice at <hi>Hector's</hi> grave.</l>
               <l>Oh for <hi>Wild's</hi> teeming Muſe! mine's at that paſs,</l>
               <l>As was old <hi>Hellens,</hi> when ſhe brake her Glaſs.</l>
               <l>My Fancy's dull, my Muſe wants feet to go,</l>
               <l>My clumſie hand is like his Gouty Toe.</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Oxford</hi> and <hi>Cambridge</hi> were invited Gueſts;</l>
               <l>My Verſes preſs like Beggars unto Feaſts,</l>
               <l>But yet <hi>Monk's</hi> farewell-Volley to advance,</l>
               <l>I'le fire my Piſtol with their Ordinance.</l>
               <l>And that his Funeral-pile may blaze the higher,</l>
               <l>I'le throw waſte paper to augment the fire.</l>
               <l>His Metal will make Mercuries of Blocks,</l>
               <l>And with his Steel, inflames my Tinder-box.</l>
               <l>What though I add my Sackcloth to their Sable,</l>
               <l>My Verſe ſuits with the cauſe, being Lamentable.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Why ſits upon each face black ſorrows Cloud?</l>
               <l>Why are the ſighs ſo deep, the groans ſo loud?</l>
               <l>Such face poor <hi>England</hi> had of Conſternation,</l>
               <l>When ſhe beheld her Father's Decollation:</l>
               <l>Our Greife's renew'd, Great <hi>George's</hi> breath doth ceaſe,</l>
               <l>The great Reſtorer of his Country's Peace.</l>
               <l>Luxurious Death could nothing pleaſe thy Palate,</l>
               <l>But thou muſt have Anchovy's for thy Sallet?</l>
               <l>Foul <hi>Cannibal,</hi> did ravine ſo prevail,</l>
               <l>That Worth nor Loyalty could be his baile?</l>
               <l>But yet thou canſt not boaſt of Victorie,</l>
               <l>His poſture ſhew'd, He ſcorn'd to ſtoop to thee.</l>
               <l>He greeted thee, (whom Nature much abhors),</l>
               <l>Sitting, as Kings do treat Embaſſadors.</l>
               <l>So would <hi>Veſpaſian</hi> entertain his fate,</l>
               <l>So <hi>Egypts</hi> Queen ſunk ſo her Chair of State.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Whom don't thy fall concern? A Starr ſo bright</l>
               <l>Setting, leaves every one with's leſſer light.</l>
               <l>By thee the Gentry kept their Dignity,</l>
               <l>From <hi>Tyler's</hi> Level, or <hi>Cade's</hi> Parity,</l>
               <l>Prelates owe thee their Miters, Kings their Crowns,</l>
               <l>Nobles their Coronets, Scholars their Gowns;</l>
               <l>Thy Country owes its Peace, being free'd from dread,</l>
               <l>Unto thy heart, three Kingdoms owe their head.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>A King and People ſweetly met in thee,</l>
               <l>He had his Crown, and they an Amneſty.</l>
               <l>His way not ſpread with Carcaſſes but Roſes;</l>

            <lg>
               <l>The Canons then did ſpeak another ſenſe,</l>

               <l>Nor <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s Acts can thy retreat out-do,</l>
               <l>In that thou fought'ſt with Foes and Fortune too.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>When thou had'ſt loſt thy Bullets in their ſides,</l>
               <l>When not befriended by thy Sailes or Tides,</l>
               <l>When foes (puſt up with Luck and Brandy) proud,</l>
               <l>Thy Canons hoarſe with ſpeaking long and loud,</l>
               <l>When thy maim'd Veſſel like a tired Horſe,</l>
               <l>Did vex thy active ſoul, and check thy force.</l>
               <l>When friends remote, but adverſaries near,</l>
               <l>Thou could'ſt ſtand fight, do any thing but fear.</l>
               <l>Thou did'ſt retire but only to refit,</l>
               <l>Not to put up thy Sword, but ſharpen it.</l>
               <l>So great <hi>Alcides</hi> tir'd at <hi>Cacus</hi> den</l>
               <l>Withdrew and breath'd, then ſet on him agen.</l>
               <l>I'le raiſe the Cypreſs of <hi>June</hi>'s Agony</l>
               <l>Above the Bayes of <hi>July</hi>'s victory;</l>
               <l>When thou didſt chaſe them with revengeful ire,</l>
               <l>And celebrate the Joy with <hi>Schelling</hi>'s Fire.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>But now inſulting Death to make a mock.</l>
               <l>Of Fortitude, feeds on a fighting Cock.</l>
               <l>Yet for his loyalty and warlike parts</l>
               <l>He is embalm'd in Tears, and Tomb'd in hearts.</l>
               <l>We prize his duſt, as <hi>Turks</hi> his name-ſakes bones,</l>
               <l>And celebrate our grief with penſive groans.</l>
               <l>The aim'd-at Gowns ſhall be for mourning Weeds,</l>
               <l>And threatened Steeples be his Pyramids.</l>
               <l>He doth deſerve a Monument far higher</l>
               <l>Than <hi>Paul</hi>'s old Fabrick topt with <hi>Strasburg</hi> Spire.</l>
               <l>His Name we will in Chronicles inſert,</l>
               <l>Which is advanc'd by duty and deſert,</l>
               <l>We'l pray that after-ages may inherit,</l>
               <l>The Loyalty and Valour of his Spirit.</l>
               <l>And that ſuch worth may be by others ſhown,</l>
               <l>But never have ſuch cauſe to make it known.</l>
